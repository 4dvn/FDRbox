[```Ableton Live MIDI Remote Script/```](Ableton Live MIDI Remote Script/) contains a MIDI Remote Script for Ableton Live. The scripts maps the faders to control the volume of the first 8 tracks. Using this script is not necessary to use FDRbox in Live (or any other DAW that support MIDI controllers), all it does it automatically map the controls.

To install the script, please refer to [*ableton.com: How to install a third-party Remote Script?*
