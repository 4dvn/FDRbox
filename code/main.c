/**
 * Overview of pins capabilities (only most common used peripherals).
 * Project works with PIC16F1454 and PIC16F1455. PIC16F1459 is not tested.
 * 
 * RA0/RA1 are used for USB.
 * RA3 is used for MCLR with internal pull-up enabled.
 * RC4 is wired to the LED. Timer2 is used by the LED.
 * 
 * General purpose I/O:
 * 
 *			IOC		WPU		ICSP	SPI		I2C		PWM		ADC (1455 only)
 * RA4		x		x				SDOalt					AN3
 * RA5		x		x								PWM2alt
 * RC0						DAT		SCK		SCL				AN4
 * RC1		INT				CLK		SDI		SDA				AN5
 * RC2								SDO						AN6
 * RC3								SS				PWM2	AN7
 * RC5												PWM1
 * 
 * All weak pull-ups are enabled by default and can be independently configured
 * with WPUA.

 * 8 faders are connected to an analog 8:1 MUX.
 * Analog in is connected to RC2 (AN6).
 * Channels of MUX are connected to RC3 : RC5 : RA4 (MSB -> LSB)
 * 
 * The MUX needs a certain time to switch channel, this shouldn't take longer
 * than 1 ÂµSec (12 instructions at Fosc = 48 MHz). We assume this delay is
 * already caused by the regular code, no additional delay is implemented.
 * Caution has to be taken to not start conversion directly after switching the 
 * channel.
 * Since the ADC has some noise on the measurements, some filtering is applied.
